TODO:
* Try different BC
* Study well posedeness of the problem
* $\sigma_i^2 = \sigma_0^2 + \widehat{\sigma}_i^2$
* Define good function $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$

IDEAS:
* Other methods for solving the ODE/PDE: FEM, Spectral Methods, ...
* Change evaluation points at each iteration
* Choose center points with knowledge of data
* Adjust $\alpha,\beta$ acording to order of magnitud of initial errors
* Force c coefficients to be positive


TODO2 (17/06/2016):
* splines para phi2
* connection between beta and (rms,er)
* \phi normalization
* \alpha(RMS)
* convolution to find grid points
* best way to compute phi_x matrices
* \lambda(x) = f(x)/RMS
* \lambda(x) = n/Er
