# Welcome to the VarClump WorkLog!


### Overview of work done until 17/06/2016
- Implemented concept test with two approaches: Variating $c,\sigma$ together and separately.
- Variational formulation and deduction (Created a Mathematica notebook with analysis and deduction)
- Implemented ELFunc classes to handle variational problems.
- Proposed two penalizing functions $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ with corresponding parameters.(Created a Mathematica notebook with analysis of each one)
- Added experiments for both approaches. Orion Nebulae CO observations are used.
- Analysis of results and their dependence with parameters of Lagrangian formulation.
- Minimal broadening of gaussians $\sigma_i^2 = \sigma_0^2 + \widehat{\sigma}^2$
- Force c coefficients to be positive


### Session WorkLog [17/06/2016]
- We need to determine a relation between model parameters and physical parameters of cube. Adjust $\alpha,\beta$ acording to the order of magnitud of RMS of data.
- Test splines for phi2 func.
- Ideas for (alpha, lambda1): \alpha(RMS) - \lambda(x) = f(x)/RMS - \lambda(x) = n/Er
- Desirable properties of psi2: Slowly penalize low variations and Fast penalizing of high variations.
- In 2D implementation, choose center points with knowledge of data: Fast convolution method...


### Between sessions WorkLog
- Created EulerLagrange1D module, to avoid rewriting the functions on each notebook.
- New Phi2 proposal: 5th order spline. Added Mathematica notebook with implementation and analysis.
- Implemented the new Psi proposal on notebooks
- Added flag to show center points on compare\_plot() function.
- added study\_of\_parameters notebook


### Random ideas:
* Better way to update phi_x matrices: e^{x^2/\sigma^2} ^= (sigma^2 / sigma0^2)
